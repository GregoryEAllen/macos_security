title: "Disallow Built In Signed SoftwareÂ to Receive Incoming Connections"
discussion: |
  The firewall must be configured to disallow built in signed software to receive incoming connections. 
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Disallowing built in signed software may prevent certain remote mechanisms used for maintenance and compliance scanning from properly functioning. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization before opting not to disallow signed software to receive incoming connections.
